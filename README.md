# Maya Plugin for Render Farms
The code I created for render farms works on Auto desk Maya. When your project is finished, you export it thanks to this plugin. The plugin examines your project and shows you if there is a problem after analyzing the rendering settings. For example, if you have not edited the format of the render output, it will give you an "output file" error and tell you that there is no render output. If there is no error, it exports the render engine settings you selected in the project, the tecture you used and similar things, and your project goes to its own file. This is how render farm plugins work." Plugins export the project in maya with the rendering engine of your choice. The software in Windows sends the exported file to the render farm site with a set of settings. And the rendering process begins. You can also: get the output after the rendering is completed.

# Which rendering engines does it examine?
  - __Vray__
  - __Arnold__
  - __Renderman__
  - __Redshift__
  - __Octane__
  - __Mental__
  - __Maxwell__
  - __Iray__

# Note
You can analyze your projects using my codes and export them, but unless there is a render farm application, the project you export cannot go to the render farm because the only thing that can be uploaded will be the render farm application you will install. so that it goes to the render farm with the exported project settings.
